assignment 10 TCP Server with MD5 Response Script
Overview

This project consists of a standalone Python script that functions as a TCP server. The server is designed to accept connections on port 5555 from TCP clients operating within the same local IP range. Upon receiving a message, the server generates an MD5 hash of the message and responds to the client with the generated MD5 digest. The server continues to operate until manually terminated by the user.

Overview

This project includes a standalone Python script that functions as a TCP client. The client is designed to connect to a TCP server operating on port 5555, as developed in Assignment 10. It sends 10 distinct messages to the server and receives the hex digest of the MD5 hash generated by the server in response. The operation showcases client-server communication and hash generation based on the "Black Hat Python" book.
Features

    TCP Client Operations: Connects to the server on port 5555.
    Message Transmission: Sends 10 messages with varying content to the server.
    MD5 Hash Response: Receives the hex digest MD5 response from the server.
    Logging: Records all messages sent and responses received.
